# SaaS-Identity-Auditor
A Python tool that ingests a list of users (mock data) and "audits" them for security violations, such as inactive accounts, missing MFA, or "Shadow Admin" privileges. Why Mozilla will like it: It directly addresses their requirement for Identity and Access Management and securing SaaS apps like Slack/Jira.
